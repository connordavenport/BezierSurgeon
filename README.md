# BezierSurgeon (Beta)

Bezier Surgeon is a Robofont extension for precision point insertion. Select the tool, have a segment selected and a new point will be drawn along with its new angle and ratio. (The math used for this follows the same algorithms as Erik van Blokland's [AngleRatioTool](https://github.com/LettError/angleRatioTool/blob/master/AngleRatioTool.roboFontExt/lib/angleRatioTool.py)), this is for cross-tool consistency. 

Do you ever find your self needing to add a point at an exact angle/ratio for a smooth interpolation? Its a tedious task of guess and check â€” now you can visualize the new points before editing the curves.
